          <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Abhinav. I'm a computer science graduate who is passionate about science and technology, and nothing makes me happier than working on distributed large scale systems. I'm always looking for new challenges, and I'm a quick learner, so don't worry, I'll get the job done! I'm also pretty laid-back in my approach, and I'm always up for a good laugh - so if you're looking for someone to add some fun to the team, I'm your guy!</p>
